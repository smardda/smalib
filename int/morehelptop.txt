smint uses Linux dialog commands to provide a simple portable GUI
based around working through a sequence of boxed dialogues, normally
moving on by clicking on an option presented below each box.
Generally both in the box and below it, selections will be made
by mouse-click, but do not click in this window before you have
finished reading it - USE THE ARROW KEYS TO SCROLL TEXT in a
box such as this one.

Options may also be selected by using the arrow keys
and hitting the space-bar to select/de-select highlighted options.
"^" and "$" will transfer from left to right selection boxes,
tab key will transfer between option buttons "< OK >" etc.
Hitting return will normally terminate any interaction immediately
with whatever options are highlighted, hitting cancel will TRY
to return to a sensible menu level with a helpful hint.

smint manipulates only files in the current working directory.
File selections (and most other actions) are dynamic, so the user
may move new data-files into the directory at any time.
There is no key-stroke logging as such, but cautious users may
find that they are able to recreate the outputs of a session from
the file cmdwrap.log and other files in  subdirectory ismtemp.
