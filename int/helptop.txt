To calculate intersections of rays with surfaces
for the first time, work through the menu items in order
to produce the surface geometry.
(The default parameter options should be OK for this.)
Output may be visualised using gnuplot and ParaView.

If this is your first use of this script, you probably
need "more information" for input conventions.

Also access documentation for SMARDDA-LIB as web-based
help launchable from the "more information" menu-box. 
Links to the ParaView manual are also provided.
There are two published papers
showing the capabilities of SMARDDA, similarly accessible.
