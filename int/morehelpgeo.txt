SMARDDA-LIB expects geometry defined in terms of mesh file formats
MSC-NASTRAN dat or kitware legacy vtk. Simple planar surfaces and
surfaces formed by rotation may also be defined and integrated.
SMARDDA-LIB aka SMALIB  will convert dat
files into vtk for further processing, since the basic unit of geometry
is a vtk file corresponding typically to one panel or tile.
Use the transform menu to define solid-body transformations of files
into new files, and the combine menu to join them one or more at a time
to produce ultimately just two files for input to SMARDDA/MOVE.
One file will contain the geometry from which rays are launched, the
other geometry that intersects the ray geometry.

By convention, geometry that has been transformed has a file-name extended
by the name of the transform, thus say panel1.vtk might become
panel1_tfm1.vtk and if a second transform is applied, panel1_tfm1_tfm2.vtk.
Beware that panel1.dat will be converted to panel1.vtk, overwriting
any pre-existing file.
