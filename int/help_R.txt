Surfaces are generated by rotation of lines about the major axis
of the torus. Lines are specified as a set of contiguous straight
segments defined by their end points in (R,Z) coordinates, mm units.
In the current directory, there should be either
one dat file with "_RZ" in the name, containing e.g.
1000 0
1500 500
2500 500
or two dat files, with names differing only in that one
has "_R" in the name, and the other "_Z", the first containing only
the R coordinates of end points, one per line, and the second
the Z coordinates, also one per line.
Input of file vital_R(Z).dat will lead to creation of file vital.vtk

Warning: if file vital_R(Z).dat is used as input, file vital.ctl
will be overwritten
