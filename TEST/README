Simple test that "wheels go round", for geofil, hdsgen and move.
The test-deck should be invoked using
./test.bash
which should take less than a minute on a high-end laptop or desktop,
creating scratch directories workdirg and workdirm, plus
workdirr to contain some specially generated rays.
The bash script will automatically diff the results with 
corresponding repo files.
