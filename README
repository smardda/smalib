SMARDDA-LIB
-----------

SMARDDA-LIB (SMALIB for short) is a set of object-oriented Fortran-95 modules for ray,
particle and fieldline tracing using the SMARDDA ray-tracing algorithm.
SMARDDA is a published algorithm for triangulated surface geometries, designed to handle
short tracks as well as 'long' rays efficiently. The central geometry format is the legacy
vtk format, with the smint tool provided for basic geometry manipulations including
conversions from other mesh formats.
For a description of the SMARDDA algorithm for ray tracing
see http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2015.2458897 (also http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6750 )

SMARDDA-LIB has been tested on CentOS 7.0, Ubuntu 18.04 and Red Hat 4.4 (Scientific Linux)
and is known to run on MacOS and WSL 1.
Try to use the latest stable fortran compiler version available.

See LICENCE.txt for details. 

To proceed to install from here (and only from here), type
export SMALIB_DIR=$PWD
source ./exec/build intel
The argument to build which is optional, will cause the script to try to use the Intel fortran compiler, 
which is advisable on ITER hpc machines as a Fortran compiler release post-2011 is needed.
Note that this script
(1) recommends you source the file ./Extras/setup so that the main
SMARDDA-LIB executables are placed on your path, essential for smint (see below) to work
(2) sets the shell variable SMALIB_DIR; you may find it a good idea to ensure
that SMALIB_DIR is always set by modifying your .bashrc file, by adding the line, for example
export SMALIB_DIR=~/smardda/smardda-lib
(3) takes an optional argument N stopping the production of documentation

bash shell release 3.2 or later (i.e. from 2005 or later) is needed.
ParaView may be downloaded separately from www.paraview.org if not already installed.

To produce the html documentation in $SMALIB_DIR/doc, note
particularly that doxygen 1.8.6+ is needed.
(For creation of user manual as a pdf the texlive/2015 module is needed:
module load texlive/2015
cd ./doc/srcdoc/latex/; pdflatex refman )

To run the test deck, it helps to know that it is 
orchestrated by file tests.bash in directory TEST.

Linux modules dated post-2011 are generally required.
The following module versions are indicative:
module load qt/4.8.7
module load paraview/4.4.0
module load GCC/4.8.3
module load dialog/1.2
module load flex
module load doxygen/1.8.8
module load gnuplot
module load convert
(others may be needed, and not all machines will have exactly these versions).
The test deck should be run before any problems are reported.

The script smint guides the user interactively through the setting up of a basic test
case, starting with the sub-class of MSC Nastran-TM .dat files output by CATIA-TM.
smint has a significant inbuilt help capability
For efficient smint interaction with ParaView, the following settings are needed:
Settings->General, Click on gearwheel, untick Show Splash Screen, tick AutoApply (near top)
(Also useful is parallel projection:
[vtk file loaded] -> Properties tab, Click gearwheel, tick Camera Parallel projection (near bottom)
See SMARDDA-LIB user manual webpages for further details of smint and smardda-lib use.
file://$SMALIB_DIR/doc/srcdoc/html/index.html
(assuming that doxygen doxyfile has been executed correctly in  $SMALIB_DIR/doc).
Note that the CADfix-TM interface between CATIA-TM and SMARDDA/SMARDDA-LIB is not supported,

The script tests.bash in $SMALIB_DIR show how SMARDDA-LIB works in detail, given the
necessary geometry in legacy vtk format. Detailed descriptions of the namelists in the .ctl
files (which control execution) may be found by pointing a browser at
file://$SMALIB_DIR/doc/srcdoc/html/classes.html
(assuming that doxygen doxyfile has been executed correctly in  $SMALIB_DIR/doc).

Developers should notice that SMARDDA-LIB was developed according to the principles and
conventions set out in http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/assets/Documents/CCFE-R%20(15)34.pdf
Production of support files and scripts for developers has been initiated.
